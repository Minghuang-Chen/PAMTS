# PAMTS

## Overview
Physiology-Augmented Multivariate Temporal Simulation (PAMTS) is an innovative framework incorporating physiological knowledge into deep learning models for the rapid inference of cell type-specific physiological mechanisms from cellular physiological data, with three main contributions:

+ Providing lower-threshold and more powerful data analysis tools may allow more researchers to explore intrinsic cellular mechanisms behind heart disease.
+ Enabling rapid and adaptive construction of physiological mechanisms to visually describe the complex electrical activity of cells, which should facilitate scientific research iterations and drug development.
+ To the best of our knowledge, we initially explored a DL-based approach to end-to-end construct implicit representations of complex physiological systems and ensure the stability of simulations over long periods.

Please wait for the project to be organized and uploaded to the repository.
